The company has raised $24 million from Partisan principals, angel investors, and High Country Ventures. Surefire has extended the development of its product line, has secured FDA clearance to sell seven products in the U.S., and has sold devices to most of the top cancer institutes.

          span.investment-name: a(href='http://www.preceptismedical.com/') Perceptis Medical, Inc.
          |  was started in 2011 to develop devices to insert tubes into pediatric patient's ear drums to achieve drainage and to stop chronic infections. Present surgeries require multiple steps with several instruments, take several minutes to complete, and require general anesthesia. Mayo Clinic has published data showing neurologic damage when pediatric patients receive general anesthetic. The Perceptis devices can complete the implantation of ear tubes in seconds and use nitrous oxide (laughing gas) as a temporary anesthetic. The procedure can be performed in a physician's office rather than in a hospital. It is likely that the Perceptis procedure will become the new standard of care in pediatric ENT cases. Partisan principals own 11% of Preceptis.

          span.investment-name Enable Injections, LLC
          |  was founded in 2011 to design, manufacture and sell wearable delivery devices for injectible drugs. The Enable Injections products can deliver drugs directly from standard vials supplied by all pharmaceutical companies, can reconstitute powdered drugs into liquids as a part of the injection procedure, can inject very viscous drugs, and can inject up to 20 ml. Such products are called bolus injection systems. No other existing drug delivery device can accomplish all of these tasks. Approximately 900 new drugs are being developed that may require bolus injection technology like that being developed by Enable Injections. The total market is expected to reach $8 billion within ten years. Partisan principals have supplied 10% of the seed capital to Enable Injections.
