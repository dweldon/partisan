<span class="investment__name">Symbiosis Corporation</span> had total invested capital of only $5,000 and financed its activities with loans and advances from its customers with operating involvement from Partisan principals. Symbiosis was the first company to develop disposable medical devices to perform minimally invasive surgical procedures. The Company's products were marketed by the Microvasive Division of Boston Scientific and by Ethicon Endosurgery. Symbiosis was sold to American Home Products (now Wyeth) in September 1994 for $175 million, and AHP subsequently sold the company to BSX. Partisan principals invested only time and advice and received a return of $2.6 million.
