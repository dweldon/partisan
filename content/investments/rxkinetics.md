<span class="investment__name">RxKinetics, Inc.</span> was founded in April 1997 to commercialize two drug delivery technologies developed at the University of Colorado. In 1999 when RxKinetics needed to obtain Series B round financing, most venture groups were focused on Internet deals. As a result, the B round was dilutive and was led by a group hostile to Partisan's operating culture. In 2006 RxKinetics was sold to Endo Pharmaceuticals in a milestone based transaction. Partisan received minimal returns on a relatively small investment.
