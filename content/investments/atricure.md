<span class="investment__name">[AtriCure, Inc.](https://www.atricure.com/)</span> was started in November 2000 to develop instruments to treat atrial fibrillation by ablating areas of atrial tissue from outside the heart via a minimally invasive surgical approach, mimicking the classic Cox/MAZE procedure. Subsequently, AtriCure has developed and marketed a device to isolate the left atrial appendage to prevent stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. The Series A and Series B financings were syndicated with Partisan, USVP, Camden, Charter and Foundation Medical Partners. AtriCure completed an IPO in August 2005 and now has a market value of approximately $1 billion. Partisan owned 6% of AtriCure initially, but has sold its holdings in open market transactions. Partisan received a 5.8 times return on its investments in AtriCure.
