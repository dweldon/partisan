<span class="investment__name">[Preceptis Medical, Inc.](http://www.preceptismedical.com/)</span> was started in 2011 to develop devices to insert tubes into pediatric patient's ear drums to achieve drainage and to stop chronic infections. Present ear tube surgeries require multiple steps with several instruments, take several minutes to complete, and require general anesthesia. Mayo Clinic has published data showing neurologic damage when pediatric patients receive general anesthetic. The Preceptis devices can complete the implantation of ear tubes in seconds with a topical anesthetic. The procedure can be performed in a physician's office rather than in a hospital or in a surgical suite. It is likely that the Preceptis procedure will become the new standard of care in pediatric ENT cases. Partisan principals own 6% of Preceptis.
