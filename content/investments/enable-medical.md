<span class="investment__name">Enable Medical, Inc.</span> was organized in April 1994 by Partisan principals and former Ethicon Endosurgery employees to develop bipolar RF surgical instruments. The only outside investors were angels of Partisan spanning successful operating executives, industry analysts and bankers and former employees who had enjoyed large liquidity returns in Partisanâ€™s portfolio. All other investment needs were financed by exchanging Enable intellectual property for equity in CardioThoracic Systems prior to the CTS IPO in 1996. This transaction resulted in a non-equity cash infusion of $10 million. In November 2000, Enable spun off a major development project to a new company named AtriCure. In August 2005, AtriCure completed an IPO and used a portion of the proceeds to purchase its parent, Enable Medical. Partisan achieved an 11.8 times return on Enable Medical.
